# LoL Lane Game Theory (Markov model + Q-Learning)

A Python RL project that models **League of Legends laning** as a simplified **2-player Markov game** and trains a policy with **Q-learning** (plus an opponent pool / self-play style setup).

We want to find out:

- *What wave-control strategy is best given we are rewarded for denying our opponent farm, getting plates, but at risk of ganks?*
- *How does the learned policy perform vs different opponent styles?*
