# LoL Lane Game Theory (Markov model + Q-Learning)

A Python RL project that models **League of Legends laning** as a simplified **2-player Markov game** and trains a policy with **Q-learning** (plus an opponent pool / self-play style setup).

See the jupyter notebook for a more sophisticated breakdown with derived results.
